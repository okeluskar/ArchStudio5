<h1>xArch/xADL Data Binding Library</h1>

<p>
	xADL data binding libraries are stored within the plug-ins that contain
	their respective xADL schema. (To see how this is done, see the <a
		href="./tools-apigen.html">Apigen</a> tool.) The advantage to this
	approach is that new schema can be automatically incorporated into
	ArchStudio's <a
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/archedit.html">ArchEdit</a>
	tool when it is compiled with those plugins.
</p>

<h1>Using the Data Binding Library</h1>

<p>
	The data binding library is built upon the <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling
		Framework (EMF)</a>. There are three ways that the data binding library
	can be used:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automatically (in ArchEdit), by ArchStudio</li>
	<li>Through an ArchStudio extension</li>
	<li>Directly, by an application</li>
</ul>

<p>
	ArchStudio automatically initializes all data binding libraries.
	However, in the latter case when using a library outside of ArchStudio,
	you must initialize the data binding libraries manually. This is done
	by simply referring to the
	<code>eINSTANCE</code>
	variable of the generated
	<code>EPackage</code>
	. For instance, the following line of code initializes the structure
	data binding library.
<pre>org.archstudio.xadl3.structure_3_0.Structure_3_0Package.eINSTANCE;</pre>
<p>
