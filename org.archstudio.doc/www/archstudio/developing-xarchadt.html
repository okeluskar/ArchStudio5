<h1>Using xArchADT</h1>

<p>
	One of the most important components that you will call as an
	ArchStudio component developer is <a href="xarchadt.html">xArchADT</a>,
	the main data store for all architecture descriptions.
</p>

<p>
	This component exposes one interface, the
	<code>IXArchADT</code>
	. IXArchADT is a distributable (that is, it doesn't pass pointers)
	version of the interface provided by the <a href="dbl.html">Data
		Binding Library</a>. Additionally, it exposes some low-level convenience
	functions that are not available in the Data Binding Library, like
	"find by ID" and "jump to parent." In order to use IXArchADT, you need
	to become familiar with the Data Binding Library.
</p>
<p>
	Please read throught the <a target="_blank"
		href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio5/blob/master/org.archstudio.demo.xarchuci/src/org/archstudio/demo/xarchuci/Test.java">Data
		Binding Library Example</a> that shows how to write a program that
	manipulates an architecture description directly using the Data Binding
	Library. It also shows how to write the same example using the
	IXArchADT.
</p>
<p>
	Now, let's look at how we translated the traditional calls to the Data
	Binding Library in the
	<code>createUsingEMF</code>
	method to calls that go through the IXArchADT in the
	<code>createUsingXArchADT</code>
	method.
</p>
<p>The first major difference to note is that objects like
	Components and Connectors never get passed across IXArchADT. Instead,
	serializable object references, called ObjRefs, are sent instead. The
	next major difference is that, since ObjRefs are opaque, no calls are
	ever made on them directly. Instead, IXArchADT does all the work for
	you.</p>

<p>Translating a call from a Data Binding Library call to an
	IXArchADT call is easy, since it's merely a matter of rearranging some
	parameters. Here's a snippet that calls the Data Binding Library from
	the Data Binding Library example program:</p>

<pre class="codeblock" style="font-size: 8pt">
	// Xadlcore_3_0Factory coreFactory = Xadlcore_3_0Factory.eINSTANCE;
	String coreNsUri = Xadlcore_3_0Package.eINSTANCE.getNsURI();
	...
	// Component componentA = structureFactory.createComponent();
	ObjRef componentARef = xarch.create(structureNsUri, "Component");	
</pre>

<p>Here, the DBL version (i.e., the commented out code) directly
	creates a Factory from which a Component is created. However, in the
	IXArchADT version, (i.e., the uncommented out code) the namespace URI
	of the factory is used and an ObjRef is returned for the created
	component. The actual factory and Component remain internal to
	IXArchADT, we only get serializable references to them that can be
	passed over a network.</p>

<p>Here is another code snippet from the example, where the
	component is modified:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" style="font-size: 8pt">
	// componentA.setId("ComponentA");
	xarch.set(componentARef, "id", "ComponentA");
</pre>

<p>Again, in the DBL version, the component is directly manipulated.
	However, with IXArchADT, all object manipulations are done on our
	behalf. Thus, we tell IXArchADT which object we want to modify, what
	property on that object, and the new value and it performs the
	operation on the object for us.</p>

<p>
	By now, you've probably noticed that there are a lot of ObjRefs
	floating around. Due to the generality of the IXArchADT, it's
	impossible for the Java compiler to type-check all the ObjRefs being
	passed into it. So, you could pass a Link ObjRef where a Component
	object should go. If this happens, it will cause a runtime exception,
	most likely an
	<code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
	to be thrown.
</p>

<h1>xArchADT Events</h1>

<p>
	As an event-based component, any change to the internal state of
	xArchADT is reported through an event. One type of event, an
	<code>XArchADTFileEvent</code>
	, indicates when files are created, opened, renamed, and closed. The
	second type of event, the
	<code>XArchADTModelEvent</code>
	is similarly emitted whenever the internal structure of one of the open
	xADL documents is changed.
</p>

<p>
	It is your responsibility as a component developer to ensure that your
	component acts correctly when it receives an
	<code>XArchFlatEvent</code>
	or any similar event. Assumptions to the contrary need to be well
	documented.
