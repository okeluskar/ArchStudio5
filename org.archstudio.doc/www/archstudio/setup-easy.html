<h1>Easy Setup Overview</h1>

<p>This document explains the procedures necessary to download and
	install ArchStudio. ArchStudio has three critical components:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A Java 2&trade; Standard Edition (J2SE) version 1.7 virtual
		machine;</li>
	<li>Eclipse version 4.3 or better; and</li>
	<li>ArchStudio itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>ArchStudio also includes some binary distributions of software (e.g., 
	<a href="http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/" target="_blank">JOGL</a>) for 
	the following operating systems:
<ol>
	<li>Windows 32-/64-bit</li>
	<li>Mac OS X 32-/64-bit</li>
	<li>Linux 32-/64-bit</li>
</ol>

<p>To support another operating system, please ask in the mailing list
	at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>If you already have Java 1.7 or Eclipse 4.3 (or better) installed,
	you may safely skip those parts of these instructions as they require
	no special configuration for ArchStudio.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Setting up Java</h2>

<p>ArchStudio (and Eclipse) are Java applications. ArchStudio is
	written for Java 2 Standard Edition version 7 (aka
	JDK1.7) or better. It will not run properly in any previous version of
	Java.</p>

<p>It is possible that you already have Java 7 installed on your
	machine. To check, start a command-prompt and run:</p>

<p>
	<code>java -version</code>
</p>

<p>
	If the version reported is (1.)7.0 or better, skip to the next step. If
	not, you will need to obtain a version of Java for your target
	environment. In general, you can obtain such a release free of charge
	from Oracle at <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java
		SE site</a>. This is generally the path to pursue. Note that Oracle offers many Java 7 packages -
	nearly any should work, although we recommend the Java Development Kit
	(JDK) package.
</p>

<p>
	Linux users may also want to investigate how Java is deployed on their
	particular distribution of Linux. Many distributions offer
	Java through their package repositories such as	<code>apt</code>.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Setting up Eclipse</h2>

<p>ArchStudio requires Eclipse 4.3 (or better). If you already have
	Eclipse installed, you may install ArchStudio into your existing
	environment and can skip to the next step. Alternatively, you can
	simply duplicate your Eclipse directory or download and extract another
	copy to create a copy of Eclipse solely for running ArchStudio.</p>

<p>
	Download Eclipse 4.3 (or better) from the <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse downloads site</a>.
	Eclipse's site should provide adequate documentation for expanding the
	archive and starting the Eclipse environment. Start Eclipse. It may ask
	you for a workspace location. This is the directory where Eclipse will
	store projects, including ArchStudio projects that contain xADL files.
	You may accept the default or choose a different directory. We
	recommend creating a new directory outside of Eclipse's install
	directory, since this makes it easier to upgrade Eclipse later without
	having to go through extra trouble to migrate your workspace to the new
	version.
</p>

<p>Once Eclipse is running, it may show the Welcome view if this is
	the first time it has been run. Close the Welcome view and the Java
	development perspective should be displayed. Once Eclipse is running,
	you are ready to install ArchStudio.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Installing ArchStudio</h2>

<p>This following steps walk you through the install of ArchStudio.
	Note that you must be connected to the Internet for this to work.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="images/archstudio-install.png"><img

				width="200px" /></a></td>
		<td>
			<p>To install ArchStudio perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to Help | Install New Software...</li>
				<li>In the "Work with:" text box (as highlighted on the left)
					enter the following URL: <a target="_blank"

				<li>Click Next</li>
				<li>Click Next again</li>
				<li>Select "I accept the terms of the license agreements"</li>
				<li>Click Finish</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Wait for Eclipse to download ArchStudio, this may take several
				minutes.</p>

		<td><p>Eventually, a security warning will appear, as shown
				on the left. Click on OK.</p>
			<p>When prompted to restart Eclipse, click Yes.</p></td>

<h1>Updating ArchStudio</h1>

<p>Updates to ArchStudio are also deployed through the ArchStudio
	update site and are available through Eclipse's plug-in update
	mechanisms. To perform an update, do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Go to Help | Check for Updates</li>
</ul>
