<h1>Archipelago: ArchStudio's Graphical Editor</h1>

<p>Archipelago is ArchStudio's user-friendly graphical editor.
   It consists of a set of functional plug-ins that provide
   depiction and editing support for various xADL modules.
   Archipelago's primary function is as a graphical,
   "boxes-and-arrows" style editor for xADL documents.
   The user interface is similar to those found in tools
   like Rational Rose, Microsoft Visio, and Microsoft
   PowerPoint.  Unlike some of these editors,
   Archipelago is cognizant of the underlying modeling
   language (xADL) and changes to Archipelago diagrams
   are immediately reflected in the underlying open
   xADL document (and vice-versa).</p>

<p>Archipelago can be opened from the
   <a href="launcher.html">ArchStudio Launcher</a> like any other
   ArchStudio editor.</p>

<p>Once the editor is opened, it primarily uses a modeless,
   context-based user interface.  This means that instead
   of using toolbars, editing modes, and the main menu,
   the primary method of editing is through context menus.
   Context menus are generally brought up by right-clicking
   on the element to be edited.  Systems with only one mouse
   button (e.g., the Macintosh) can access context menus
   by holding a modifier key (usually Control) and clicking
   on an element).</p>

<p>In general, editing in Archipelago starts from the tree
   in the Outline View.  Right-clicking on these elements will
   allow you to manipulate top-level, 'container' elements
   in a xADL document such as structures, types, statecharts,
   and so on.  In general, double-clicking on one of these
   container elements will open the element in the editor
   pane.</p>

<p>The editor pane will usually be a graphical editing
   canvas.  In a new container element, the canvas may be empty,
   in which case right-clicking on the blank canvas will present
   options for creating new elements.</p>

<p>Graphical editing canvases generally support arbitrary zooming
   and scrolling.  Scrolling can be done with the scrollbars, and
   zooming can be done with the scroll wheel on the mouse.
   Turning the scroll wheel up (away from you) will zoom
   in; turning the scroll wheel down (toward you) will zoom
   out.  Pressing the scroll wheel down (as a mouse button) will
   cause the cursor to change to the 'hand' cursor.  While the
   scroll button is depressed, moving the mouse will cause the
   canvas to scroll along with the movement of the mouse, like
   putting your hand down on a piece of paper and moving the paper.
   The combination of zooming and scrolling with a wheel mouse
   is much faster and more intuitive than the scrollbars, and we
   recommend that all Archipelago users invest in wheel mice
   to take advantage of this.</p>

<h2>Representative Screenshots</h2>

<p>Some example screenshots of Archipelago are shown here,
   to illustrate some of its capabilities.</p>

   <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2">
     <tr>
       <td><a href="images/archipelago/01-archipelago-new.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archipelago/thumbnails/01-archipelago-new.png" alt="Archipelago Screenshot"/></a></td>
       <td>
         This shows Archipelago opened on a new, empty document.
         Right-clicking on the various nodes in the outline view will
         allow new container nodes (structures, types, and so on) to
         be created.

       <td>
         This shows a simple, one-level structure created in Archipelago.
         Two components are connected via an intervening connector.

       <td>
         This shows a more complex, <a href="archipelago-hierarchy.html">hierarchical structure</a>.  The two components
         now have internal structures that show how they are constructed
         internally.
       </td>

     <tr>
       <td><a href="images/archipelago/04-archipelago-endtoendmapping.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archipelago/thumbnails/04-archipelago-endtoendmapping.png" alt="Archipelago Screenshot"/></a></td>
       <td>
         This structure shows the above hierarchical structure, but end-to-end
         mappings have been added to show how the internal structures interact
         through interfaces on the outer structure.

       <td><a href="images/archipelago/05-archipelago-autolayout.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archipelago/thumbnails/05-archipelago-autolayout.png" alt="Archipelago Screenshot"/></a></td>
       <td>
         This shows the Archipelago auto-layout dialog; Archipelago uses the
         freely-available Graphviz layout engines to lay out architectural
         structures.
       </td>

       <td><a href="images/archipelago/06-archipelago-hierarchicalediting.png"><img style="border: 0" src="images/archipelago/thumbnails/06-archipelago-hierarchicalediting.png" alt="Archipelago Screenshot"/></a></td>
       <td>
         In ArchStudio, Archipelago fully supports hierarchical editing.
         This means that inner architectures can be edited in an enclosing
         diagram, without having to "drill down" to the diagram containing
         only the inner architecture.
